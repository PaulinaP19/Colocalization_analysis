# Colocalization analysis
# ImageJ macro to batch remove out of nucleus intensities based on DAPI mask
# then deconvolve images using theoretical PSF
# then measure colocalisation between red and green channels as well as red and far red channels in 3D 
# requires Coloc2 and Iterative 3D deconvolution plugins
# requires the PFS files to be located in the root folder an
# select 2 directory for output
# after deconvolution, corresonding channels are merged in one multi-channel image
